# ![Racket RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Racket codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

> **NOTE:** This is a very early work in progress.

### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Racket** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Racket** community styleguides & best practices.
_(Well, we hope so! That sentence is from the template `README.md` file:
currently it is aspirational for this very early work-in-progress
implementation._)

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
